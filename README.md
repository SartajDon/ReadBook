# ReadBook
This is my first ever python code that I 
am writing myself and a little bit of research.
There might be errors

Technical things
1. Make sure you have a book/document/file etc in 
.txt format.

2. (git clone https://github.com/xcodesource/ReadBook)

3. Put that book in same directory where 
words_finder.py is
          or 
Do something advance people do by providing
A directory.I don't know what that is called.

4. I have downloaded 1-1000.txt from @deekayen
Which you can check 

5. change your book name which words you
want to find out to abcd.txt 

6. Move your book into ReadBook using 'mv' 
Command

7. cd ReadBook

8. run: python3 words_finder.py

          This should work
