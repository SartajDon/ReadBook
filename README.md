# ReadBook
This is my first ever python code that I 
am writing myself and a little bit of research.
There might be errors

Technical things
1. Make sure you have a book/document/file etc in 
.txt format.

2. Put that book in same directory where 
main.py code is
          or 
Do something advance people do by providing
A directory.I don't know what that is called.

3. Download 1000 common words from this person
https://gist.github.com/deekayen/4148741#file-1-1000-txt
which I have used in my code
        or 
Here is direct link:
wget https://gist.githubusercontent.com/deekayen/4148741/raw/98d35708fa344717d8eee15d11987de6c8e26d7d/1-1000.txt

4. change your book name which words you
want to find out to abcd.txt 
5.run the code.

          This should work
