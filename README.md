# ReadBook
This is my first ever python code that I 
am writing myself and a little bit of research.
There might be errors

Technical things
1. Make sure you have a book/document/file etc in 
.txt format.

2. git clone https://github.com/xcodesource/ReadBook

3. Put that book in same directory where 
words_finder.py is
          or 
Do something advance people do by providing
A directory.I don't know what that is called.

4. Download 1000 common words from this person
https://gist.github.com/deekayen/4148741#file-1-1000-txt
which I have used in my code
        or 
Here is direct link:
wget https://gist.githubusercontent.com/deekayen/4148741/raw/98d35708fa344717d8eee15d11987de6c8e26d7d/1-1000.txt

5. change your book name which words you
want to find out to abcd.txt 

6. Move your book into ReadBook using 'mv' 
Command

7. cd ReadBook

8. run: python3 words_finder.py

          This should work
