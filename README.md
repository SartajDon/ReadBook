# ReadBook
This is my first ever python code that I 
am writing myself and a little bit of research.
There might be errors

Technical things
1. Make sure you have a book/document/file etc in 
.txt format.
2. Put that book in same directory where 
main.py code is
          or 
Do something advance people do by providing
A directory.I don't know what that is called
3.change your book name to abcd.txt
4.run the code
This should work
